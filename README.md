# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

Description: A password that is randomly generated based on questions answered by the user

# Notes

I wasn't sure where to start with the JavaScript, more comments in my notes. 

I ended up finding a code that was very similar and worked off of that for this homework. Code was here https://github.com/TiffanyCasey/Password-Generator

Everything seems to be working fine, I'm just going to need to practice and study extra about JavaScript.
